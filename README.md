# Federal-Register-Agentic-RAG-System

This project builds an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system on top of the Federal Register API + MySQL + VectorDB using LangChain and LangGraph.

It allows you to:

ðŸ”„ Ingest & sync Federal Register documents into MySQL + VectorDB

ðŸ§  Query using natural language (e.g., "Show me Defense Department notices from July 2025")

ðŸ›  Run an agent that decides between SQL queries, VectorDB semantic search, and summarization

âš¡ Use Ollama LLMs (e.g., qwen2.5, llama3) for reasoning and summarization
